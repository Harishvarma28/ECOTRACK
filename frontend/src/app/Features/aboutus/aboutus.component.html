    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="about-us-description">
      Welcome to our Recycling Project! Our mission is to make recycling more efficient, accessible, and effective for everyone. We believe that small actions can create big changes, and we're committed to improving the recycling process for a better, more sustainable future.
    </p>

    <div class="how-we-got-idea">
      <h2>How We Got the Idea</h2>
      <p class="animated-text">
        The idea for this project came from a common challenge we observed in our communities: many people want to recycle but are unsure of the best ways to do so, or they feel that recycling is inconvenient and time-consuming.
        After discussing the issue with various community groups and environmental organizations, we realized that there was a significant opportunity to develop a platform that makes recycling simple, efficient, and rewarding for individuals and businesses alike.
      </p>
      <p class="animated-text">
        Our team came together with the goal of creating a solution that would not only educate people about recycling but also streamline the entire process. By using modern technology, we aimed to create a seamless experience that enables people to recycle responsibly, track their impact, and be rewarded for their efforts.
